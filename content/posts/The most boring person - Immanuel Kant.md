"Act that you use humanity, whether is your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means."

"Each person must never be treated only as a means to some other end, but must be also treated as an end themselves."

- Cheating is unethical for a similar reason. You are violating the expectations of other rational and sentient beings for your own personal aims.

	- If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and make that change.

"We are not rich by what we possess but by what we can do without."
