I'm summarizing the course "Presentation skills".

Three obstacles of effectively speak:

1. People are easy to forget, even for those they just heard about.
2. People are easy to judge the speaker by their first impressions
3. Two many disattractions for both the speaker and audiences.

"if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough." - einstein

The most successful speech is the one who speak all simple stuff but let you hard to forget.

Tips for create the slides:

1. Don't exceed 36 characters per page.
2. Don't exceed 7 words per sentence.
3. Don't exceed 3 colors per page.
4. Font size should >= 24
5. Talk at least 3 minutes for a single page, otherwise the page no need exist.

Handle nervous:

1. Be practiced with your topic
2. Familiar with the environment before you start

"I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear." - The king's speech

People go to listen your talk is sharing their time with you, let both worth it.
