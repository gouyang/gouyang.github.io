			 	<h1>The Most Boring Person - Immanuel Kant</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">08/21/2018</span>
			      <pre><code>- He woke up every morning at 5:00 AM
- Write for exactly three hours
- Lecture at the same university for exactly four hours
- Lunch at the same restaurant
- Walk through the same park on the same route
- Go to bed at exactly 10:00 PM
- Live his entire life in konigsberg, east of Prussia
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Act that you use humanity, whether is your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each person must never be treated only as a means to some other end, but must be also treated as an end themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Lying is wrong because you are misleading another person&rsquo;s conscious behavior in order to achieve your own goal.</li>
<li>Cheating is unethical for a similar reason. You are violating the expectations of other rational and sentient beings for your own personal aims.</li>

<li><p>Violence, same deal.</p></li>

<li><p>The duty of self-improvement, the Michael Jackson Maxim.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and make that change.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>The duty of self-respect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;We are not rich by what we possess but by what we can do without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
