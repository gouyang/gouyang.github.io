    <p>ssh with public key works for a really long time, but it just goes wrong these two days.
At first I was just tried to delete old publick key files, re-generate it and upload them, but it seems not enough.</p>

    <p>How to set the default browser in terminal for every applications?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve searched this and figure out this before, but still spend lots of time to find the answer today.
It seems the perfectly way is, add below contents to ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.</p>

    <p>Here records some simple github workflows, all of these can be searched out on github help.<br />
Based on my personal experience so far, they looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Syncing a fork repo from upstream</li>
<li>Send PR based on branch</li>
<li>Pull a PR to local for testing or merging.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>People are easy to forget, even for those they just hear about.</li>
<li>People are easy to judge the speaker by their first impressions.</li>
<li>Two many disattractions for both the speaker and audiences.</li>

    <p>Once I have tried Awesome window manager, I will not leave it.</p>

<p>Awesome becomes my favor WM because it&rsquo;s really lightweight, and a few shortcuts meet my all needs.</p>

<p>I intend to make it as lean as possible with less configurations.</p>

<h1 id="first-the-layouts:a20ea495d573f939e205d9abef7f341b">First, the layouts.</h1>

<p>There are totally 12 layouts can be used, after try each of them, I only use 3 of them now.
Maybe others is useful for some cases, which I do not aware of them becore I really know how to use them.</p>

<p>The three I used are:</p>

<ul>
<li>floating</li>
<li>tile</li>
<li>max</li>
</ul>

<p>The most used layouts by me is max, because I need a big screen for everything. Tile is used for
compare something or copy-read something, like copy content from browser to vim, some websites do not support copy.</p>

<p>So I comment others and use the three like this:</p>

<pre><code>-- {{{ Tags
-- Define a tag table which hold all screen tags.
tags = {}
for s = 1, screen.count() do
    -- Each screen has its own tag table.
    tags[s] = awful.tag({ 1, 2, 3 }, s, {layouts[3], layouts[2], layouts[1]})
end
-- }}}
</code></pre>
